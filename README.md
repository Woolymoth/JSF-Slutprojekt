# JSF-Slutprojekt

A schoolproject built with an API: https://lotrapi.co/api/v1/.

So far this project fetches information from four different urls:

"https://lotrapi.co/api/v1/characters"
"https://lotrapi.co/api/v1/cities"
"https://lotrapi.co/api/v1/books/"
"https://lotrapi.co/api/v1/films/"

The goal is to build a web page that works together with an API to fetch relevant information for the user.
It includes the use of Typescript, Javascript, Scss, Css, Html coding and the use of JSON.
The project is divided into several files and folders, which is as following.


* The "index.html" is the main html file which the project is built upon.


* The "Scss" and "Css" documents are in their own separate folders, where the code is separated into five different documents depending on what area of the HTML it touches on. In the Css folder they are combined in the document mainstyle.css


* The "code.ts" is the typescript document which contains the code that fetches the information from the API and translates it to information readable by the HTML. The code.js is the very same code compiled to javascript by tsc and NODE.


* The "tsconfig.json" has the configurations used during this project and should be kept the same if chosen to further build upon it.


* The ".gitignore" is used for files that are unnecessary for git to track.


To use and/or add to the project you need to clone the repository from github, as long as you have the tsconfig that is included in the repository you do not need to touch it further.


Compile the typescript from your input prompt to make sure that the code runs and that the Javascript is up to date with the Typescript.


Open up the HTML on your browser, try out the buttons and admire the scenery.
