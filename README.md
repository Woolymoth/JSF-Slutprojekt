# JSF-Slutprojekt

A schoolproject built with an API: https://lotrapi.co/api/v1/.

The goal is to build a webbpage that works together with an API to fetch relevant information for the user.
It's including the use of Typescript, Javascript, Scss, Css, Html coding and the use of Json.

To use and/or add to the project you need to clone the repository from github and instal Json, as long as you have the tsconfig that is included in the repository you do not need to touch it.

When you use tsc to compile the typescript to javascript make sure to return the comments to normal code in the javascript.
